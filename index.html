                    Necessary Products&trade; was founded by Fan Duran Glan in 2019 as an answer
                    to the global shortage of necessary products. Fan looked around and saw that
                    the world was lacking something that probably only he could provide. He set
                    to work on trying to establish his brand so that he could make some products,
                    but it wasn't until 2019 that he eventually came up with the name that would
                    carry him to relative success. He is now leading a team of more than half a 
                    person including himself and works tirelessly to make the things that people
                    need. After many years of struggling with a market that was resistant to such 
                    high levels of necessity, Fan eventually made a name for himself in 2019, on
                    his website, which can be seen below. <br><br>
